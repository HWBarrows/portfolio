                <p> In November 2021 I looked at a JavaScript event object for the first time. Seeing that it was possible to break down an event to the exact pixel clicked, I finally understood the power of programming. Since that fateful day, I've been passionately learning as much as I can about new and emerging technologies and creating fun projects along the way.</p>
