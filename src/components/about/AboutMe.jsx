                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Hallie Barrows and I love bright colors, Marvel comics, and technology.</p>
                <p>In November of 2021, I dissected a JavaScript event for the first time in my life, using my web browser's developer tools. Seeing that the event target could be identified, down to the exact pixel clicked, was such an eye-opening experience; I felt like Dr. Strange when the Ancient One showed him the Multiverse in Kamar-Taj.</p>
                <p>Knowing that this massive world of knowledge exists, inspires me to discover as much as I can about JavaScript, React, Node, API's, deployment, version control, data structures and relations, and many other new and emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>Since that fateful November day, I've been creating digital products that reflect my rich background. My birthplace of New York City provides a colorful and playful aesthetic. Copenhagen brings clean lines and clarity to the pallet. Berlin inspires creativity.</p>
                <p>The result are web apps that easy to navigate, visually appealing, and distinctly me.</p>
